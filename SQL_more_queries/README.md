# SQL - MySQL

This project advances into intermediate SQL concepts using **MySQL**. It covers user management, privileges, database constraints, and advanced query techniques such as **Joins**, **Unions**, and **Subqueries**. You will also learn how to model data relationships using Primary and Foreign Keys.

## ⚙️ Requirements

### General
* **Allowed editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be executed on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **MySQL 8.0** (version 8.0.25)
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your SQL queries should have a comment just before
* All your files should start by a comment describing the task
* All SQL keywords should be in **uppercase** (`SELECT`, `WHERE`…)
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### 📝 SQL File Comments
Your SQL files should follow this comment structure:
```sql
$ cat my_script.sql
-- 3 first students in the Batch ID=3
-- because Batch 3 is the best!
SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE batch_id = 3 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
